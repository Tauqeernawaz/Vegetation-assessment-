# Vegetation Assessment using Google Earth Engine (GEE)

This repository contains **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** scripts for vegetation analysis using **NDVI**, **MNDWI**, and **VFC** derived from **MODIS** and **Landsat** datasets. The analysis covers the years 2001-2021.

## Dataset Information
The dataset is derived from the **MODIS** and **Landsat** products:
- **MODIS** data: [MODIS Website](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/)
- **Landsat** data: [Landsat Website](https://landsat.visibleearth.nasa.gov/)

The vegetation indices are calculated using the following steps:
1. **NDVI** (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is used to assess vegetation health and cover.
2. **MNDWI** (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index) is calculated to assess water bodies.
3. **VFC** (Vegetation Fraction Cover) is derived to estimate the fraction of land covered by vegetation.

## How to Use
1. Sign in to [Google Earth Engine](https://code.earthengine.google.com/).
2. Copy and paste the provided **GEE script** into the editor.
3. Run the script to calculate NDVI, MNDWI, and VFC for your desired region and time frame.
4. Analyze and visualize the outputs within **Google Earth Engine** or export them for further analysis in **ArcGIS**.
